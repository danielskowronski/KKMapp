# KKMapp
universal windows (for desktops and phones) _unofficial_ app for checking KKM (Krakowska Karta Miejska /Cracow City Card) valid public transport tickets

### current status
in-dev, basic version published

### features
  * check valid tickets by card ID for given day (remembering data across devices)
  * reminders before expiration date
  * live tile with info (usable to keep it on bottom of start menu)
  * tickets prices
  * in next generation - nice GUI wizard for buying tickets (finalization including payment would be handled by kkm website - it's unofficial app) and e-ticket transaction status list (like "ready to be coded on ticket machine" or "payment in progress" with notifications)
